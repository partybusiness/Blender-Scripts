A couple scripts for use in Blender.

.py files are add-ons and can be placed in a folder like this:

[Users]\[YourUserName]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\[YourBlenderVersion]\scripts\addons

.txt are just snippets you can copy and paste into a window set to be a Python Console. Rather than any parameters, you might have to change variables right in the script.
